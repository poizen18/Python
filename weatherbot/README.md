# Weatherbot

## How it works:
This script will connect to an IRC server of your choice (localhost by default) and join a channel (smalltalk by default). Once connected the bot will watch for users typing "!weather City,State" (e.g. !weather Bend,OR). When a user requests weather for a location, Weatherbot will reply with the conditions and temperature for that location.
