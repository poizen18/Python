# Karmabot

<strong><p>How it works:</p></strong>
<p>This script will connect to your IRC server (localhost by default) and respond to various prompts
<ul><li>Typing ++ in IRC will give karma to an item (e.g. Karmabot++)</li>
<li>Typing -- in IRC will take karma away from an item (e.g. Karmabot--)</li>
<li>Typing !rank and then an item will let you know how much karma it has (e.g. !rank Karmabot)</li>
<li>Typing !top will list the top 5 items by karma</li>
<li>Typing !bottom will list the bottom 5 items by karma</li>
<li>Typing !help will print a list of options</li>
</p>

</p>The script uses json load/dump to periodically store existing karma in a file and load it on startup</p>
