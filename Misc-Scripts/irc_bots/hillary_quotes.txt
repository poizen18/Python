Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different -- they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.
He's not just unprepared -- he's temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.

This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Saudi Arabia.

Making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake.
